# Tetris Effect: Connected Autosplitter

**The autosplitter has not been verified yet! Please be patient.**

This autosplitter is designed to record IGT for Tetris Effect: Connected speedruns.

The TE:C Autosplitter will automatically be downloaded by LiveSplit. When you select Tetris Effect: Connected as your game, an option will show up to activate the Autosplitter. Activate it, then click Settings to change when it will split. If you uncheck Split on Area, the Autosplitter will still start and reset the timer, and will split at the end of the run. This will work if you don't have any splits.

### Troubleshooting:

For an unknown reason, the Autosplitter doesn't always work the first time. If it doesn't work right away, try again. If this fixes the problem, you shouldn't run into it again.

If the Autosplitter still doesn't work, open the settings while the game is open, and verify that it has found the correct version. If it has, you will see it in the top right. If you don't see anything, close and reopen the game.

Send me a message if the Autosplitter shows the wrong version, doesn't show any version even after reopening the game, or otherwise doesn't work for some reason.
